Automated API Dependency Analysis

## Vision

* Ingest facts from programmable sources about dependencies, this can be call sites through static code analysis, logs or traces for dynamic analysis, and even documentation, repositories, and other consumable sources for building a depency analysis
* Open source engine and commercial product for enterpise scale depenendency analysis
* The community repository of dependency specifications, contribute to a public dataset of dependencies

## Tech

Haskell should be capable, deadpendencies was recently built in Haskell and is in a similar solution space.
